The sloppy answer is: you are free to do whatever you like with the generated code, as long as 
you don't blame the author for any malfunction or damage caused by the program.

# Code sample

These commands create CRC-32 code which is compatible with python3 binascii, zlib CRC32 and so on.

````
python3 pycrc.py --model crc-32 --algorithm table-driven --generate h -o crc.h
python3 pycrc.py --model crc-32 --algorithm table-driven --generate c -o crc.c
